            START FROM YOUR PREVIOUS VERSION OF SPOTIFY
            The goal is to implement, as a team:
            - Album Page
            - Artist Page
            - Search Feature
            For the Album Page, use the https://deezerdevs-deezer.p.rapidapi.com/album/{id} API.
            You can get the album ID from the search API es.: json.data[0].album.id
            For the Artist page, use the https://deezerdevs-deezer.p.rapidapi.com/artist/{id} API
            You can get the artist ID from the search API es.: json.data[0].artist.id
            On every Song in the main page, add artist and album. 
            By clicking on Album the user must go to the specific album page
            Use the query string parameter to pass the ID, example:
            artist.html?id=141414
            Same thing for the album, when the user click on the album name, it should be redirected to something like:
            album.html?id={id album}
            Search should allow free search in the songs db.
